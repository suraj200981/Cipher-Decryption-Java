Exercise 1 (2 marks)
The plaintext comes from tess26.txt and is encoded with a Caesar cipher.
Exercise 2 (3 marks)
The plaintext comes from tess26.txt and is encoded with a Vigenere cipher using
the 21-letter key TESSOFTHEDURBERVILLES.
Exercise 3 (4 marks)
The plaintext comes from tess26.txt and is encoded with a Vigenere cipher. The
key is an arbitrary sequence of six letters (i.e. not necessarily forming an English
word).
Exercise 4 (5 marks)
The plaintext comes from tess26.txt and is encoded with a Vigenere cipher. The
key is an arbitrary sequence of between 4 and 6 letters.
Exercise 5 (5 marks)
The plaintext comes from tess26.txt and is encoded with a transposition cipher,
as follows: the plaintext is written row-wise across a certain number of columns, 
between 4 and 6. (You must figure out how many columns were used.) The
ciphertext is formed by reading out successive columns from left to right.
Exercise 6 (5 marks)
The plaintext comes from tess26.txt and is encoded with a transposition cipher,
as follows: the plaintext is written row-wise across six columns. The ciphertext is
formed by reading out successive columns in an arbitrary order (which you must
figure out to decipher the message). Hint:look for common pairs of letters, such as
'th'.
Exercise 7 (6 marks)
The plaintext comes from tess27.txt and is encoded with a general substitution
cipher, using a randomly chosen mapping from the 27-character alphabet onto
itself. Note that normally (i.e. except by chance) a vertical bar will be mapped
onto some other letter of the alphabet.
